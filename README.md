# Chess GUI Project

This repository contains the **Chess GUI** project, a Python-based graphical interface for playing chess. The project demonstrates the use of a GUI framework to implement a classic chess game with functionality for both human-vs-human gameplay, move validation, and game state management.

## Project Overview

The **Chess GUI** project aims to provide an engaging and visually appealing chess game experience for players of all skill levels. It adheres to the official chess rules, offering a smooth interface to enjoy the classic board game.

The project uses Python's GUI libraries (such as `tkinter`, `pygame`, or others) to create an interactive and functional chessboard. It provides the logic for moving pieces, validating moves, and determining checkmate, stalemate, or draw conditions.

### Key Features
- **Graphical User Interface**: A fully functional, interactive chessboard GUI for a seamless user experience.
- **Legal Move Validation**: Ensures players can only make moves that are legal according to official chess rules.
- **Game State Management**: Tracks the progress of the game, including turns, check/checkmate detection, and win conditions.
- **Move Highlighting**: Highlights available moves for the selected piece, providing clarity to players on possible actions.
- **Undo/Redo Functionality**: Allows players to revert or reapply moves, enhancing the gameplay experience.
- **Player Timer (Optional)**: A countdown timer for each player to simulate competitive play.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed to be accessible to players of all levels, with intuitive controls and a visually clean layout.
- **Custom Themes**: Optionally allows players to choose different color schemes for the board and pieces.
